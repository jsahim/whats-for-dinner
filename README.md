# What's for Dinner? 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
- I was able to build a meal selector app that allows you to login with your name, then displays a welcome message with the users name. The user can then choose from sides, mains and desserts to generate a randomized selection from each. This application solves the problem of what to eat tonight. So many people have trouble deciding on what they should eat, so this takes out the guesswork.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
- The user must first create GitHub account: 
- Fork the following repository: https://github.com/jsahim/whats-for-dinner
- In terminal, they will need to run the following to clone down the GitHub repository:
    - git clone git@github.com:jsahim/whats-for-dinner.git
- Once the repository has been cloned to tmv heir local machine, they can open it in their preferred text editor

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
- I am half way through Mod 1 and I was given 5 days to work on this project.

### Contributors:
[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to their GitHubs.)
- Jeff Sahim: https://github.com/jsahim

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
- Gain experience building an application that utilizes HTML, CSS and JavaScript
  - I believe that I demonstrated a fair command of all 3 languages to create my application. 
- Write HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
  - While I accomplished the general framework that was required in the comp, I took some liberties with the style to make it my own. 
- Understand how to listen to and respond to user events
  - While I stumbled at times with events and event listeners, I was able to accomplished my needed flow.
- Individualize your programming skill set
  - CSS seems to come more naturally than I expected, of course I am still far from a sufficient amount. I do however really enjoy the customization.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
 - One win was that I was having a really hard time moveing variable values between multiple HTML pages, but I found a way to transfer a value to the other HTML page using a GET method. This was both the win and the challange.
- Another win was finally be able to reason my way through a problem instead of insteincively reaaching out for help. I'm proud of how much was accomplished autonomously. It was challanging to resist the urge to reach out.
